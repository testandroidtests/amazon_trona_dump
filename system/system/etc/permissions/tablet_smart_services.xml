    <!-- com.android.providers.downloads is in power save white list.
    In original AOSP implementation, com.android.providers.downloads uses sharedUserId="android.media"
    and runs in android.process.media process. com.android.providers.media uses sharedUserId="android.media"
    and runs in android.process.media process too. So the service in com.android.providers.media can be start.
    When we change com.android.providers.downloads from android.media to android.download to support SharedAssetStorage,
    com.android.providers.downloads does not run in android.process.media process. The services in com.android.providers.media
    can not be started for process android.process.media is in background mode. To fix this issue, we need add
    com.android.providers.media into power save white list.-->
