    <!-- This feature provides ability for a gaming application to control alexa
    state as on/off when it is in game mode. By default, Alexa will always
    remain unavailable when the system enters game mode.

    This is being introduced for Luna app where we want alexa to remain available
    when the user is in lobby and actual game play is yet to begin.

    By declaring the feature com.amazon.gamemode.alexa_in_game_mode here, the api
    PackageManager.hasSystemFeature(String feature) will
    return true if passed this name. -->
