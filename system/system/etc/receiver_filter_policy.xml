         Ope option is to block a <package> statically from showing up in PackageManager by specifying
         package name as well as actions/mimetype to block. The use-case for this is to block the official
         social-network 3P applications for those mimetype for which Amazon has matched functionality natively.

         Another option is to block an <activity> dinamically from showing up in PackageManager.queryIntentActivities,
         for a given endpiont. The use-case is to not allow certain Amazon social-network integration to be available
         in some countries, depending on business/government regulations.
