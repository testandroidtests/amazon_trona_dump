# This is the init.rc wrapper script for FireOS. It should consist purely
# of import directives. All init script logic should go into a file
# directly or recursively imported from here. Do not add any init script
# content to this file.
#

# Service blocks that override stock AOSP should be defined in this file.
# These are usually different per-vendor, and sometime per-chip.
import /init.base.rc
# The unmodified stock AOSP init.rc is renamed to init.aosp.rc during
# compilation for FireOS product configurations. Most target-specific init
# scripts are recursively imported from this file.
import /init.aosp.rc
