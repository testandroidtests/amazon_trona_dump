    mbcl_bypass - 0 (To enable PreFilter and MBCL), 1 (To bypass PreFilter and MBCL)

    mbcl_inVol - is MBCL input volume, or, systen gain
    ranges from -15 (i.e., -15.0 dB) to +20 (i.e., 20.0 dB).

    mbcl_prefilterBypass - 0 (To enable PreFilter), 1 (To bypass PreFilter)

    comp_inputVol_dB - is compressor input volume, expressed as inpVol_dB * 10,
    ranges from -200 (i.e., -20.0 dB) to +150 (i.e., 15.0 dB), i.e., 15 for 1.5 dB

    comp_ratio - is compresssor ratio, expressed as ratio * 10,
    ranges from 10 to 200, i.e., 15 for 1.5

    comp_thresh - is compressor threshold in dB, expressed as comp_thresh * 10,
    ranging from -900 to 0, -800 for -80 dB

    comp_gainMin_dB - is the amount of compression, expressed as comp_gainMin_dB * 10,
    ranges from -400 to 0, -300 for -30 dB,
    -100 has more compression effect than -50.

    lim_release - is the release time in ms
    lim_thresh - is limiter threshold expressed as thresh * 10
    i.e. -45 for -4.5
    acceptable values are -150 to 0 i.e minimum threshold supported is -15 dB

    lim_inputVol_dB - is Limiter input volume, expressed as inpVol_dB * 10,
    ranges from -100 (i.e., -10.0 dB) to +100 (i.e., 10.0 dB), i.e., 15 for 1.5 dB,

    frequency (FilterBank FC) for different band's have following limitations
    // 70 <= fc1 <= 115 in step of 5 Hz
    // 150 <= fc2 <= 220 Hz in step of 5 Hz, 225 Hz <= fc2 <= 550 Hz in step of 25 Hz
    // fc2 = 750/875/1000/1250/1500/1750 Hz
    // 750 Hz <= fc3 <= 5000 Hz in step of 250 Hz; fc3 = 875 Hz, 7500 Hz
